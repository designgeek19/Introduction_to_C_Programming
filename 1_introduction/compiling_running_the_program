# Compiling and running the "Hello World" program

# After creating the "Hello World" Program:

#include <stdio.h>

# int main(void);
# {
#       printf("Hello World\n");
#       return(0);
# }
#
# After writing the program, you use the gcc compiler to compile the code in the file "hello.c"
# run the command "gcc hello.c". This command will:
# * read the cource file
# * process it
# * link it with the runtime library
# * create a new file "a.out"
# if you run the "ls" command, you will see the new executable file "a.out" with the source file "hello.c"
# you can check the permission status by running "ls -l"
# to run the program, use the command "./a,out"
# to change the program name:
# * delete the "a.out" file with the command "rm a.out"
# * Instruct the compiler to compile the "hello.c" source file and put the output inside a new executable file named "hello".
# *Use the code "gcc hello.c -o hello"
#
# Optionally:
# to create a new executable file from the existing source file "hello.c", you can use the "make" command
# * "make hello"
# this would compile your program and add the output inside a new executable file named "hello"
# you can run the "hello" program with "./hello" to see the output.ls
