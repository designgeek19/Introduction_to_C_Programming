Arithmetic & Logical Expressions in C

Arithmetic expressions and logical expressions are two types of expressions in the C programming language.

Arithmetic expressions involve mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. These operations are performed on numerical values, including variables, constants, and expressions that evaluate to numerical values. For example:

less
Copy code
int a = 10, b = 5;
int result = a + b; // Arithmetic expression
In this example, the expression a + b is an arithmetic expression that performs addition on the variables a and b.

Logical expressions, on the other hand, involve logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT. These operations are performed on Boolean values, which are values that are either true or false. Logical expressions typically involve the use of comparison operators such as greater than (>), less than (<), equal to (==), not equal to (!=), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=). For example:

css
Copy code
int a = 10, b = 5;
if (a > b && b != 0) // Logical expression
{
    // Do something
}
In this example, the expression a > b && b != 0 is a logical expression that performs the AND operation between the expressions a > b and b != 0. If both expressions evaluate to true, then the if statement's body is executed.
