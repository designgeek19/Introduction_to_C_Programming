**What is looping and Branching:

In C programming, looping and branching are important concepts used to control the flow of execution of a program.

Looping refers to the process of executing a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. In C, there are several types of loops, including the "for" loop, "while" loop, and "do-while" loop. These loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times, with different conditions controlling how many times the loop is executed.

For example, here is a "for" loop that will print the numbers from 1 to 10:

for(int i=1; i<=10; i++){
  printf("%d\n", i);
}
In this loop, the code inside the curly braces will be executed 10 times, as the condition i<=10 will eventually become false after 10 iterations.

Branching, on the other hand, refers to the process of changing the normal flow of execution of a program. In C, branching is typically accomplished using conditional statements, such as "if" statements and "switch" statements. These statements allow you to specify different paths of execution based on whether certain conditions are true or false.

For example, here is an "if" statement that will print "Positive" if a variable x is greater than 0, and "Negative" if it is less than or equal to 0:

if(x > 0){
  printf("Positive\n");
} else {
  printf("Negative\n");
}
In this code, the "if" statement checks whether the condition x > 0 is true or false, and executes the code inside the curly braces accordingly. If the condition is true, the program will print "Positive". If it is false, the program will execute the code inside the "else" block and print "Negative".
