# Example Program
#
# write a program in vi named "input_output.c" with the following code:
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
        printf("My full name initials are: %c%c%c and my age is %d.\n",'P','O','A',28);
        return(0);
}

# Exit your vi and compile the code with: gcc input_output.c -o input_output
# Rin the executable file with: ./input_output
# this would print out the output on your terminal.
# But, if you want your output to be a standard output, you need to redefine the code:

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
        char f,m,l;
	int age;

	scanf("%c %c %c %d", &f, &m, &l, &age);
	printf("My full name initials are: %c%c%c and my age is %d.\n",f,m,l,age);
        return(0);
}
